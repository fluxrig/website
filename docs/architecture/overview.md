# Architectural overview

The **fluxrig** architecture is a modular, event-driven system designed to separate centralized orchestration from distributed execution. It functions as a high-performance connectivity layer that enables deterministic processing across heterogeneous distributed environments.

> **Core Principle**: **Wires are Persistent Signal Paths** (NATS JetStream).
> Intra-Rack and Inter-Rack communication use the *same* high-fidelity protocol (`fluxMsg`), ensuring location transparency and uniform observability across the entire mesh.

## Design Philosophy

While the platform is technically a distributed system, its architecture is inspired by the modularity and signal integrity of professional audio studios.

## System components

The platform is built on a modular architectural model that strictly separates centralized orchestration from distributed execution.

| Component | Role | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mixer** | Control Plane | The central orchestration node and entity registry. Manages global state and configuration. |
| **Rack** | Distributed Node | A decentralized execution node running the processing logic (Gears) defined in a Scenario. |
| **Gear** | Logic Unit | A modular unit of processing logic (Native/Wasm) responsible for specific tasks. |
| **Wire** | Signal Path | A deterministic, unidirectional persistent queue (NATS JetStream) connecting gears. |
| **Snake** | Secure Tunnel | The persistent, outbound-only **mTLS** connection between a Rack and the Mixer. |
| **Scenario**| Topology Config | Declarative YAML defining the execution topology and signal routes. |
| **Spec** | Schema | Defines the structure of external payloads natively via **SDL**. |
| **Registry** | Identity Ledger | The centralized source of truth for node identity, security secrets, and telemetry indexing. |
| **fluxMsg** | Data Model | The universal binary data structure (CBOR) for all internal signals. |
| **Warehouse**| Storage | *[Roadmap]* Partitioned cold storage for audit logs and historical telemetry (Parquet). |
| **Studio** | Console UI | *[Roadmap]* The browser-based management console for visual topology building. |

## The gear model

A **Gear** is the primary logic unit. It functions as a pluggable, high-resolution signal processor that can be chained together via **Wires** to form complex, low-latency pipelines.

*   **Execution Strategy**: Supports high-performance **Native Gears** (compiled Go) and agile, sandboxed **Wasm Gears** (pluggable polyglot logic).
*   **The Port Model**: Communication is strictly governed by standardized entry and exit points (**Ports**) that enforce signal integrity.
*   **Observability**: Every Gear is observable by default, with throughput and latency telemetry tapped directly from the execution path.

> [!NOTE]
> The pipeline above shows a **passthrough** flow: two distinct I/O gears bridge two different external connections, and every arrow is a unidirectional Wire. A **request/response** flow with a single external endpoint looks different: it uses **both ports of the same I/O gear**, with one wire pair carrying the request away from its `out` port and the response back to its `in` port. Only the external sockets are bidirectional; see [the port model](./gear.md#the-port-model).

## The rack (distributed execution)

The Rack is the "execution case" running locally or at the edge. It is designed to be **Static, Self-Contained, and High-Performance**, acting as the runtime environment for local signal processing.

*   **Core**: A compiled **Go binary** (`fluxrig`).
*   **Deterministic Engine**: Embeds NATS JetStream and the Wasm runtime.
*   **Zero-Agent Footprint**: Observability (OTel) and configuration management are embedded directly in the binary.
*   **Hosted Gears**: Executes gateways, codecs, and logic units as a unified pipeline.

### Sovereign autonomy
The Rack is designed for **Sovereign Continuity**. Unlike traditional thin clients, it continues functioning in "offline mode" if the Mixer is unreachable, maintaining local data processing and transformation integrity even during backhaul failure.

## The control plane (Mixer)
The **Mixer** is the central nervous system and **Project Authority** for the rig. It governs identity, orchestrates topology updates, and aggregates telemetry.

*   **The Operational Ledger (Registry)**: A hybrid source of truth that maintains node identity, security secrets, and a distributed telemetry index. It leverages **DuckDB** for active state and **Parquet partitions** for historical analysis.
*   **Analytics**: A high-performance telemetry engine providing real-time operational visibility through the Ledger.
*   **Orchestrator**: Manages the deployment and hot-reloading of **Scenarios** across the fleet.

### The ledger architecture
The Registry functions as a **Unified Operational Ledger**. In the current release, it provides a single gateway to query both the **Active State** (currently connected nodes) and **Cold Storage** (historical logs and metrics partitioned by time).

- **SQL Access**: Direct querying of the active registry schema.
- **Unified Query**: Transparently joins active data with Parquet-backed historical trails using DuckDB's `read_parquet` extensions.

## The data plane (Rack)
The **Rack** is the high-performance execution engine that lives locally or at the infrastructure boundary. It is designed for absolute autonomy and wire-speed performance.

*   **Gear Runtime**: A lightweight, non-blocking execution environment.
*   **Sovereign Autonomy**: Racks execute logic based on their local **Passports** (cryptographically-signed configuration snapshots), ensuring zero business downtime even if the Control Plane becomes unreachable.
*   **OTel Ingest**: Local telemetry collection and buffering with resilient outbound delivery.

## The orchestration spectrum

Unlike monolithic gateways, **fluxrig** operates across a high-fidelity **Orchestration Spectrum**. We separate the "Hot Path" (Mission-Critical Signal Processing) from the "Cold Path" (High-Assurance Business Orchestration).

1.  **Passive Monitoring**: Non-intrusive shadow mirroring of traffic for risk-free validation.
2.  **Mission-Critical Signal Processing**: The low-latency Rack pipeline for protocol normalization and localized logic.
3.  **High-Assurance Business Orchestration**: The Mixer-hosted **Durable Orchestration** engine for long-running processes (e.g., settlements, disputes).

> [!TIP]
> For sector-specific implementations of this spectrum, see the **[Payment](../use_cases/payments.md)**, **[IoT](../use_cases/iot.md)**, and **[Industrial](../use_cases/industrial.md)** architectual spectrums.

## Transaction flow strategy (two-speed)

### The hot path: mission-critical signal processing
*   **Scope**: Real-time signal processing and authorization.
*   **Performance**: Sub-millisecond overhead (< 500µs typical).
*   **Engine**: **Native Rack pipeline**.

### The cold path: high-assurance business orchestration **[Roadmap]**
*   **Scope**: Long-running, stateful business processes (e.g., smart reversals, settlements).
*   **Goal**: Ensure eventual consistency and correctness for complex workflows.
*   **Engine**: **[Roadmap]** Durable Orchestration (Temporal).

### Workflow vs execution

| Feature | **Durable Orchestration** [Roadmap] | **Deterministic Processing** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Role** | **Director**: Decides *what* and *when*. | **Processor**: Decides *how* (I/O & Logic). |
| **State** | **Stateful**: Full workflow history. | **Stateless**: Message-at-a-time. |
| **Latency** | **High** (ms to days). | **Ultra-Low**: (microseconds). |
| **Example** | **Example**: "Run Reconciliation A, then B." | "Transform ISO8583 to CBOR." |
