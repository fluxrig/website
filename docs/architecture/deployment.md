# Deployment architecture

**fluxrig** is designed to scale from a single developer workstation to a multi-region institutional network. Our deployment model enforces a strict separation between the **Stateless Execution Edge** (The Rack) and the **Centralized Control Plane** (The Mixer).

## Architecture tiers

1.  **The Control Plane (Mixer)**: A central orchestration node that manages policy, identity (Registry), and telemetry aggregation. In {{VERS}}, the Mixer is a **Sovereign Single Node**, with a multi-node **HA Cluster** implementation on the engineering roadmap.
2.  **The Data Plane (Racks)**: A fleet of decentralized execution nodes. While Racks are currently horizontally scalable as independent nodes, **Native Rack Clustering** is planned to enable seamless multi-node coordination at the edge.

## Technical reference: ports & protocols

For network administrators and SREs, the following table summarizes the project's **standard default** port and messaging mapping. All ports are fully configurable via the `fluxrig.toml` configuration or the Scenario specification.

| Component | Default Port | Proto | Purpose | Direction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mixer API** | `8090` | TCP (HTTP) | Centralized Control & Observability API | Inbound to Mixer |
| **Snake (NATS)** | `4222` | TCP (mTLS) | Distributed Message Bus (The Snake) | Inbound to Mixer |
| **ISO8583 IO** | `8583` | TCP | Standard Financial Industry Port | Inbound/Outbound |
| **Generic TCP** | `9000` | TCP | Standard fluxrig Demo Port | Inbound/Outbound |

All internal platform communications follow two primary subject hierarchies to ensure absolute isolation between the management plane and the operational data plane.

| Subject | Plane | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`fluxrig.agent.>`** | **Management** | Orchestration signals: Hello, Heartbeats, Scenario Updates. |
| **`flux.telemetry.>`** | **Telemetry** | High-resolution OTel signals (traces, logs, metrics). |
| **`flux.msg.>`** | **Data** | Primary data-plane business signals between gears. |
| **`flux.ctrl.>`** | **Control** | Secure control-plane signaling (Kill Switch, Hot Reload). |

## Binary strategy

To simplify operations and reduce the maintenance surface, **fluxrig** is distributed as two focused, high-performance binaries.

### `fluxrig` (The Sovereign Node)
*   **Role**: The stateless execution edge. Contains the **Rack** runtime and the operational CLI.
*   **Build**: Pure Go (Static). Zero external dependencies (no glibc requirements).
*   **Target**: Edge gateways, industrial IoT devices, and secure CI/CD runners.
*   **Footprint**: Minimal (~45MB binary), optimized for resource-constrained edge environments.

### `fluxrig-mixer` (The Orchestrator)
*   **Role**: The centralized control plane. Contains the **Mixer**, the entity registry, and the high-resolution analytics hub.
*   **Build**: Go with embedded C-extensions for performance (DuckDB).
*   **Target**: Private data centers, cloud regions, or local management hubs.
*   **Embedded Services**: NATS JetStream (Message Bus) and DuckDB (SQL Analytics).

## Deployment tiers

### Standard tier (Autonomous Edge)
**The Zero-Dependency Experience.** Designed for local development and single-node edge sites. The Mixer and Rack typically operate as a unified, self-contained unit.

*   **Architecture**: Local execution with embedded persistence (DuckDB).
*   **Dependencies**: Zero. No external databases or sidecars are required.
*   **Sovereignty**: All state is stored in a local, immutable write-ahead log (WAL).

### Institutional tier (Distributed Infrastructure)
**The Sovereign Network.** Designed for high-availability environments (Financial Infrastructure, Industrial Plants) requiring air-gapped operation and multi-region resilience.

*   **Topology**: Fully distributed logic. Multiple Racks connect back to a high-availability Mixer cluster via secure channels.
*   **Persistence**: Integrates with external OLAP backends (e.g., ClickHouse for high-concurrency telemetry archival).
*   **Isolation**: Optimized for air-gapped data centers with zero dependency on the public internet.

## Clustered resilience [Roadmap]

To ensure **Zero-Downtime** operations at the edge, institutional deployments utilize **Rack Clustering**.

*   **Stateless Scaling**: Racks share no local execution state except for the **Scenario** blueprint. This allows any node in a cluster to handle any incoming signal path.
*   **Failover**: If a node fails, traffic is re-routed by the Layer 4 Load Balancer or the NATS mesh to healthy nodes.
*   **Transactional Consistency**: The Mixer coordinates **Saga Orchestration** to ensure eventually consistent states during node failures, managing required reversals or compensations automatically.

## Sovereign Continuity
A core strength of the **fluxrig** architecture is **Sovereign Continuity**. This principle guarantees that the **Data Plane is independent of the Control Plane's real-time availability**.

*   **Offline Execution**: If the Mixer or the Snake Tunnel goes offline, Racks continue to process business signals without interruption using their signed `state.flux` Passports.
*   **Decoupled Failure Domains**: A failure in the central Mixer inhibits management operations (e.g., deploying new scenarios) but has zero impact on the mission-critical transactional hot-path.
*   **Automatic Recovery**: When connectivity is restored, Racks automatically reconnect via the Snake Tunnel and flush any buffered telemetry logs to the Mixer.

## Operational lifecycle: hot-reload

**fluxrig** supports the dynamic update of execution topologies (Scenarios) without requiring a full binary restart. However, for audit transparency, users should understand the current state-transition model.

### The Hot-Reload Gap (Current Limitation)
In {{VERS}}, the hot-reload of a Scenario involves a **coordinated restart of the internal Gear pipeline**.

*   **Downtime**: There is a millisecond-scale gap in signal processing while the new topology is bridged and I/O gears re-bind to their ports.
*   **Signaling**: The reload is triggered via a `ScenarioUpdate` signal on the `flux.ctrl.>` management hierarchy.
*   **Roadmap (v0.5.0+)**: We are engineering a "Shadow Swap" mechanism to achieve **True Zero-Downtime Reload**, where the new pipeline is initialized in parallel and traffic is cut over atomically.

## Hybrid-cloud orchestration

Organizations minimizing infrastructure overhead can leverage our **Hybrid-Cloud** model. In this configuration, **JAAB Tech** operates the centralized Mixer and Analytics hub while you retain absolute ownership of the **Edge Racks**.

*   **Sovereignty**: Your business data remains on-premise (The Rack), while the complex orchestration and lifecycle management are handled as a service.
*   **Connectivity**: Racks connect to the managed Mixer via the **Snake Tunnel**, requiring no inbound firewall modifications at the edge site.
