# fluxrig

**fluxrig** is a high-performance connectivity and protocol orchestration platform for distributed mission-critical infrastructure.

It provides a unified control plane to route, transform, and monitor data streams across heterogeneous environments (from industrial IoT sensors to global payment networks). **fluxrig** transforms complex, siloed technical debt into a standardized, configuration-driven data flow.

## Why fluxrig?

fluxrig is designed for environments where data integrity and edge autonomy are non-negotiable.

1. **Edge-to-Cloud Orchestration**: Manage thousands of distributed nodes as a single cohesive system.
2. **Protocol Agnostic**: Native support for ISO8583, JSON, Protobuf, and legacy binary protocols.
3. **Configuration over Code**: Deploy complex routing and transformation logic via declarative YAML: no custom coding required for standard integrations.
4. **Sovereign Autonomy**: Edge nodes operate independently, ensuring business continuity even during backhaul outages.

### Design philosophy: The professional audio logic

We borrow our architectural nomenclature from professional audio engineering to describe complex data flows with both precision and scale:

*   **The Gear**: A modular unit of logic (e.g., an ISO8583 codec or a Modbus adapter).
*   **The Rack**: An edge node that hosts and executes multiple Gears (like a stage rack).
*   **The Mixer**: The central Front of House (FOH) control plane that manages the fleet and aggregates telemetry.
