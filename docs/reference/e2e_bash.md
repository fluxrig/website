# E2E bash scripting

The **fluxrig** E2E suite is a collection of shell scripts designed for **Infrastructure-Level Regression**. These tests validate the platform's behavior regarding process lifecycle, operating system interactions, and network resiliency.

## Philosophy
Unlike functional tests (handled by Robot Framework), E2E Bash tests treat the binary as a "Black Box." They focus on:

*   **Binary portability**: Ensuring the Go binary runs on target distributions.
*   **Resource hygiene**: Verifying file descriptor management and memory usage.
*   **Signal handling**: Validating graceful shutdown on `SIGTERM`.
*   **Network partitioning**: Testing how the Rack recovers when NATS is unreachable.

## Suite structure
Tests are located in `test/e2e/` and organized by component:

| Suite | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `01_simple` | Basic Rack/Mixer bootstrap and health check. |
| `02_telemetry` | Verification of DuckDB ingestion and OTel trace propagation. |
| `03_registry` | Local topology validation and Mixer/Rack handshake. |
| `04_offline` | Sovereign Rack operation during network disconnection. |
| `05_cli` | Exhaustive validation of admin CLI commands and filtering. |
| `06_conflict` | Identity collision handling and certificate rotation. |
| `07_load` | High-level stress testing using the **[iso8583-tool](tools/iso8583_tool.md)**. |
| `08_tls_simple` | Secure channel verification for Rack-to-Mixer links. |
| `09_io_tcp` | Low-level TCP framing and connection lifecycle validation. |
| `10_iso8583` | Specialized validation for ISO8583 binary protocol handling. |
| `11_coatcheck` | State persistence and "Resumable" transaction logic. |
| `12_specs` | SDL validation and CAS (Content-Addressable Store) integrity. |

## Running tests
To execute the full regression suite:

```bash
# Navigate to your local fluxrig repository root
cd path/to/fluxrig
./test/e2e/run_all.sh
```

### Running individual tests
Each suite contains a `run.sh` script:

```bash
cd test/e2e/01_simple
./run.sh
```

## Implementation notes
*   **Isolation**: Each test suite typically spins up a dedicated NATS instance and temporary data directories to ensure a clean slate.
*   **Assertions**: Validation is performed using standard linux utilities (`grep`, `curl`, `jq`) checking logs, API responses, and file contents.
*   **Artifacts**: Failed tests preserve their log and data directories for debugging.
