# Orchestration scenarios

A **Scenario** is a declarative YAML file that defines the operational topology for the entire environment, which Gears run, how they connect, and what specs they reference.

## Lifecycle

1. **Author** a scenario YAML (locally or in version control).
2. **Import** into the CAS store with a `name:tag` reference:

   ```bash
   fluxrig scenario import payment_flow.yaml --name payment-flow --tag v1.0.0
   ```

3. **Load** at Mixer startup via CLI flag or configuration:

   ```bash
   fluxrig-mixer -s payment-flow:v1.0.0     # From store
   fluxrig-mixer -s ./scenarios/test.yaml    # From file
   fluxrig-mixer                             # Resume last active
   ```

4. **Activate**, the Mixer validates, persists, and wires the scenario.

### Hot-reloading & rollbacks

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Implementation Note**: Currently, applying a scenario update triggers a **full Gear Restart cycle**. All active gears are stopped and re-initialized with the new configuration. This introduces a sub-second processing gap and closes established I/O connections (e.g., TCP sessions). 

**Future Roadmap**: Achieving true **Zero-Downtime Reload** (where unaffected gears continue processing while new configurations are swapped in) is a primary engineering objective for the **future milestone**.

If you import a broken scenario containing invalid wires or missing specs, the Mixer performs **pre-flight validation** and rejects the transition, ensuring the cluster remains on the last known good state.

## Startup resolution

When the Mixer starts, the `startup_scenario` reference is resolved using three strategies:

| Reference Format | Example | Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *(empty)* | `""` | Resume the last active scenario from the store (non-fatal if none found). |
| File path (contains `/`) | `./scenario.yaml` | Read YAML from file, import, and activate. Fatal on error. |
| `name:tag` URN | `payment-flow:v1.0.0` | Resolve from the CAS store via `manager.Load()`, import, and activate. |

The `file://` prefix is optional for file paths (e.g., `file://./scenario.yaml`).

## YAML schema

```yaml
meta:
  name: Payment Processing       # Required. Human-readable name.
  version: 1.0.0                 # Required. Semantic version.

racks:
  - name: rack-prod-01           # Explicit target.
    config:
      location: "montevideo-dc1"

  - group: edge-gateways         # Target group.
    match:
      labels:
        role: "gateway"
    defaults:
      log_level: "info"

gears:
  - name: iso-inbound
    type: io_iso8583
    deploy: edge-gateways        # References a group or specific rack.
    config:
      mode: "server"
      port: 8080

wires:
  - from: iso-inbound.out
    to:   router.in
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Wires are unidirectional.** Each entry moves messages one way: from an **output** port (`from`) to an **input** port (`to`). External TCP sockets are bidirectional, but that duality ends at the I/O gear boundary: a request/response exchange always requires a **pair** of wires, one carrying requests away from the I/O gear's `out` port and one delivering responses back to its `in` port. See [the port model](../architecture/gear.md#the-port-model).

## Gear deployment

The `gears` section defines which logic units are active and where they are executed.

```yaml
gears:
  - name: iso-inbound
    type: io_iso8583
    deploy: rack-alpha           # Optional. Target Rack name.
```

### Global gears

If a gear does not specify a `deploy` target, it is treated as a **Global Gear**. 

*   **Behavior**: The gear will be pushed to and executed by **every Rack** that connects to the Mixer and receives the scenario.
*   **Use Case**: This is ideal for "Zero-Config" Getting Started scenarios or for deploying universal monitoring/diagnostic gears across a distributed cluster without knowing the dynamic Rack names in advance.

## Pipe configuration

The `wires` (or `pipes`) section defines how data flows between Gears.

> [!NOTE]
> **Endpoint grammar.** A wire endpoint is `gear.port` (the rack is taken from the gear's `deploy`) or `rack.gear.port` (an explicit rack / replica instance). Every segment is dot-free — **port names use underscores for roles** (`in_reply`, `out_scheme_a`), never dots — so `a.b.c` is always `rack.gear.port`. A wire naming an undefined rack/gear, or a port a gear does not declare, is rejected at import. See [the port model](../architecture/gear.md#wire-endpoint-naming).

### Transport modes

| Value | Mode | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `standard` | **NATS JetStream** | **Default**. Durable, persistent, and observable via NATS CLI. Safe for financial data. |
| `memory` | **Go Channel** | **Turbo** `[Roadmap]`. Volatile, in-memory pointer passing. Zero-copy (if within same process). Fastest possible speed, but no durability. |

> [!NOTE]
> **Turbo (`transport: memory`) is [Roadmap].** The GoChannel fast lane is in technical design; today all wires use the `standard` (NATS JetStream) transport. The example below shows the intended syntax.

### Example: hybrid wiring

```yaml
meta:
  name: High-Freq Vibration Monitoring
  version: 1.0.0

wires:
  #  TURBO MODE: 1000Hz Vibration Data
  # We pipe raw specs to the filter in RAM to avoid disk I/O overhead.
  - from: mqtt-in.out
    to:   noise-filter.in
    transport: memory

  # STANDARD MODE: Aggregated Alerts
  # The filter outputs only 1 msg/sec (Anomalies).
  # We WANT this to be durable and visible on the NATS bus.
  - from: noise-filter.alert
    to:   cloud-uplink.req
    # transport: standard (Implicit)
```

## Versioning & storage

Scenarios are stored in the same Content-Addressable Store (CAS) as Specs. Each imported scenario is:

- Hashed (SHA-256) and stored as an immutable blob.
- Indexed under `name → tag → hash`.
- Retrievable via `name:tag` or `sha256:hash`.

The special tag `latest` resolves to the highest SemVer tag for a given name.

See [Spec & Scenario Manager](spec_manager.md) for details on CAS internals and the `fluxrig scenario` CLI.
