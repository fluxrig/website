# WebAssembly SDK Contract

This document defines the Application Binary Interface (ABI) and host capabilities required to build a custom `fluxrig` WebAssembly (Wasm) Gear. Because fluxrig relies on a language-agnostic Wasm execution environment ([Wazero](https://wazero.io/)), you can author your business logic in any language that compiles to `wasm32-freestanding` or `wasm32-wasi` (e.g., Zig, Rust, C++, Go, AssemblyScript) by adhering to this contract.

## Filter Architecture & Implicit Ports

> [!NOTE]
> **Current Topology Role**: The Wasm gear is currently implemented strictly as a **Filter** gear (1-to-1 or 1-to-0). It is designed to receive exactly one input message, process it synchronously, and return exactly one output message (or drop it).

Because of this strict filter pattern, the Wasm gear uses **implicit ports**. You do not need to define a `ports` block in its configuration.
- **Input (`.in`)**: The router automatically routes incoming messages to the gear's `.in` port, which triggers the Wasm `process()` function.
- **Output (`.out`)**: The result returned by `process()` is automatically emitted on the `.out` port.

*(Support for Source/Split Wasm gears that generate spontaneous messages via `env.emit` is planned for a future release).*

## The Memory Interface

WebAssembly restricts execution to an isolated linear memory sandbox. To pass data between the `fluxrig` host (the Rack) and the Wasm guest (your Gear), you must export basic memory allocation functions.

### Required Exports

Your Wasm module **must** export the following three functions:

#### 1. `alloc`
```text
alloc(len: i32) -> i32
```
Called by the host to allocate memory inside the guest's linear memory.
- **`len`**: The number of bytes to allocate.
- **Returns**: An `i32` pointer to the allocated memory block.

#### 2. `free`
```text
free(ptr: i32, len: i32)
```
Called by the host to free memory previously allocated by the guest.
- **`ptr`**: The starting pointer of the memory block.
- **`len`**: The length of the memory block in bytes.

#### 3. `process`
```text
process(ptr: i32, len: i32) -> i64
```
The main execution entrypoint. Called by the host when a new message arrives at the Gear.
- **`ptr`**: A pointer to the CBOR-encoded `fluxMsg` payload (already written to guest memory by the host).
- **`len`**: The length of the CBOR payload in bytes.
- **Returns**: A packed 64-bit integer (`i64`). The host uses bitwise shifting to unpack this into two 32-bit integers:
  - **High 32 bits**: The return pointer to the modified CBOR payload.
  - **Low 32 bits**: The return length of the modified payload.

If you wish to drop a message, return `0`. 

## Host Imports (Capabilities)

To interact with the host system (e.g., logging or state access), the host exposes a set of functions under the `env` namespace. You must import these explicitly in your language.

#### `env.log`
```text
env.log(level: i32, ptr: i32, len: i32)
```
Emits a structured log message to the Rack's central telemetry stream.
- **`level`**: The severity level (e.g., `1`=Debug, `2`=Info, `3`=Warn, `4`=Error).
- **`ptr`**: Pointer to the UTF-8 encoded log message.
- **`len`**: Length of the log message.

#### `env.emit` [Roadmap / Future]
```text
env.emit(ptr: i32, len: i32)
```
*(Planned for a future release)*. Allows the Wasm gear to spontaneously generate new messages or split a single message into multiple messages (Fan-out). The Wasm module allocates memory, writes the CBOR payload, and calls `env.emit`. The host reads the memory and pushes the message to the wire asynchronously.

*(Future capabilities like `flux_kv_get` or `flux_req_http` will also be exposed under the `env` module, governed by scenario-level permissions).*

## Signal Format (CBOR)

For extreme performance, the `fluxrig` host does not pass strings or JSON. Input payloads are **CBOR encoded** (RFC 8949) representations of the `fluxMsg` struct.

Your module must:
1. Decode the CBOR payload from the input pointer.
2. Apply business logic to the `fluxMsg` fields (e.g., routing headers, raw payload, metadata).
3. Encode the modified data back into CBOR.
4. Allocate space for the new CBOR data.
5. Return the packed pointer/length.

## Memory Lifecycle

1. **Host receives a message** on the bus.
2. **Host calls `alloc(len)`** on the guest to reserve space.
3. **Host writes** the CBOR payload into guest memory at the returned pointer.
4. **Host calls `process(ptr, len)`**.
5. **Guest processes** the message, allocates new memory for the result, writes the new CBOR, and returns the packed `u64`.
6. **Host reads** the new CBOR from the returned pointer.
7. **Host calls `free`** on both the original input pointer and the new output pointer to prevent memory leaks.
